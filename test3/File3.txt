The common usage of "type theory" is when those types are used with a term rewrite system. The most famous early example is Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. Church's Theory of Types[1] helped the formal system avoid the Kleene-Rosser paradox that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a higher-order logic.
